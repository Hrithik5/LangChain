What are the different types of AI agents?\\n\\nAI agents vary widely based on their design and purpose. Common types include:\\n\\n Reactive agents that respond to specific stimuli without memory.\\n Deliberative agents use reasoning and planning to make decisions.\\n Learning agents that improve performance over time by analyzing past interactions.\\n Hybrid agents that combine multiple capabilities to handle complex tasks effectively. [...] AI agents have rapidly become essential drivers of innovation and efficiency in today’s enterprise landscape. They automate processes, enhance decision-making, and enable scalability, helping businesses stay competitive in an increasingly AI-driven world. However, building these agents successfully requires the right tools, frameworks, and observability solutions to ensure they operate reliably and responsibly within a complex technology ecosystem.\", \"score\": 0.99992394, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/agent-builder/how-to-build/\", \"title\": \"How to Build an AI Agent - Salesforce\", \"content\": \"### Step 5: Test and validate the AI agent\\n\\nDeveloping an AI agent involves testing and validating the system to ensure it performs as expected and meets the goals you've set. This step helps you identify and fix any issues before the AI agent is fully deployed.\\n\\nStart by running the AI agent through a series of predefined tasks or queries to see how it responds. This is like giving it a mini-exam to see if it learned what it was supposed to. [...] That completes your training! Building and training your own AI agent may seem like a lot, but with Salesforce you’re at the forefront of technological innovation that fuels your business forward. Gain access to cutting-edge tools and frameworks that simplify the training process, ensuring your AI agent is both intelligent and efficient. As you harness the power of AI, you'll reach new levels of productivity and insight, transforming data into actionable strategies for growth. [...] There are many types of AI agents, including as assistive agents and autonomous agents. An example of assistive agents are those that can be embedded within employee tools to help them with personalized tasks that are specific to their role. Meanwhile, autonomous agents can understand and respond to customer inquiries without human intervention. This is done by using an agent builder, like Agentforce, to create agent operate dynamically — as opposed to following predefined rules — and are\", \"score\": 0.99987173, \"raw_content\": null}], \"response_time\": 1.35, \"request_id\": \"ee60e684-e974-4b72-be53-78b8cfce0ef0\"}\n",
